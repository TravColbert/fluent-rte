Here is a list of known bugs and issues.  As issues are resolved we will 
update this list.

== Tested Browsers ==

The app has been tested on:

 * Gecko browsers - e.g. Firefox / Seamonkey / Ice Weasel
 * Google Chrome

It is not recommended to use this app on Internet Explorer < v8.

== UI Issues ==
 
The provisioning module is an AJAX app.  This leads to issues that we 
are still working on such as:

 * If you first click on a link sometimes the menu and title dissappear 
 replaced by strange-looking pages.  This seems to be related to the 
 AJAXical nature of the web app.  Usually, after clicking on the links 
 the problem goes away.
 
 * If you add/delete/edit objects the list does not automatically 
 refresh indicating the changed objects.  Workaround: re-click on the 
 link in question.  e.g. If you add a subscriber and the list does not 
 reflect the change.  Click on "Accounts" > "Show Accounts" to refresh 
 the list.  This problem seems to be related to browser caching issues. 

== Operational Notes ==

 * When you create a new object data is already present in the form's 
 fields.  This was intended to be sort-of a feature.  The idea was to 
 have "sample" data already present on the form to help in filling-out
 the new object.  The data that is retrieved and put in the form is the 
 data of the last object of the type you are creating.

 * After you create a SIP device you cannot change the MAC address.  
 This is intended since the MAC address is the ID for the device's 
 record.  You should create a new device with the correct MAC address, 
 make all the appropriate (re)assignments, then delete the erroneous
 record.
