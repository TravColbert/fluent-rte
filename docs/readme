= The OOo Import Tool =

You can also use the OpenOffice Calc (spreadsheet) program to manage the
provisioning data.  This might be especially interesting for two 
reasons:

 1. Managing large amounts of data 
 2. Initially entering large amounts of data

Firest we have to create the filter, then we can use the filter to open
data pulled directly from the Provisioning system.
 
To create the tool do the following:

 1. Open OpenOffice Calc
 2. Tools > XML Filter Settings
 3. Click "New" button
 4. Filter Name: Provisioning
 5. Application: OpenOffice Calc (*.ods)
 6. File Type: Provisioning
 7. File Extension: XML
 8. Click the "Transformation" tab
 9. At the "XSLT for import" enter http://server/xml_to_OOo.xml
 10. Click "OK" to save

That created a "filter" that Open Office will use when it encounters an
XML file of the Provisioning type.

To use the tool do the following:

 1. Start OpenOffice
 2. File > Open > File Name: http://localhost/index.php?q=subscriber
 3. Select "Provisioning" in the file type dropdown box
 4. Click "OK".  The data will start importing
 5. OpenOffice Calc will automatically open with all the subscribers
    data.
